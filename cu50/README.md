        Now listening on: https://localhost:5001

        Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]

    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
        Content root path: D:\git_ws\aspnetcore\cu50
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
        Application is shutting down...

As we can see, default env for our local run is `Production`.
